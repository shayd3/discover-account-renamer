# discover-account-renamer
Instead of 'Savings Account (1234)'... How about 'Move Out Fund?' or maybe 'New PC?' With this extension, you can do that! Only works on Discover Savings accounts for now.

# How to use
1. First, clone this repo and navigate to it. The folder `app` is the extension itself.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` and click `Load Unpacked` on the top left hand corner
3. select the `app` folder and it will load the extension in your browser!
4. Go to your Discover Portal and click `Edit` under your accounts. It will turn the boring old `Savings Account` title to an input box. Input what you want to call the account and click out of it. It will save that account name next time you navigate to the portal!


# Coming soon
* `Accounts` drop down when on Credit Card page
* `Accounts` drop down when on a Savings Account page
